This source code has come a long way. First, I used QuickBASIC 4.5 and and my User Interface Library (TxMUI).
Soon I upgraded to QuickBASIC Extended 7.0 and TxMUI. Next, I got hold of Visual Basic for DOS and ported the
code for that compiler and changed all the UI code to "Ruby". Eventually, when I started using Visual Basic 6.0
for Windows, I ported this code and once again I had to changed the UI code. And now, thanks to Microsoft,
I have ported the code to Visual Basic .NET! When porting for Visual Basic .NET I modularized and "class"ified
most of the code. Although most of the code was translated by the VB.Net translator, I had To make a lot of changes.
The AI is very silly and should have been much better. I should have used minimax/negamax with alpha-beta pruning to find
the best move. Since I don't have much time (for this code) I am not going to do it (here). The Think() function
should be a very good starting point. Eventually, I also cleaned up the UI. Building it in VB.NET from scratch
eliminating all legacy UI code. This code frankly speaking is open source/freeware. You can do whatever you want with it.
I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you,
your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk.
