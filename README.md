Classic Connect 4 against computer 
Notes: I started programming this during 1997 using QuickBASIC 4.5 and my User Interface Library (TxMUI).
Due to the limited nature of the QuickBASIC IDE I had to keep the source code slim & trim. Hence you won't
find a lot of comments. But I believe that understanding this BASIC code should be a snap. Most of the code has
remained virtually the same. Only the use user interface parts have changed. This source code has come a long way.
First I used QuickBASIC 4.5 and TxMUI. Soon I upgraded to QuickBASIC Extended 7.0 and TxMUI. Next, I got hold
of Visual Basic for DOS and ported the code for that compiler and changed all the UI code to "Ruby".
Eventually, when I started using Visual Basic 6.0 for Windows, I ported this code and once again I had to
changed the UI code. And now, thanks to Microsoft, I have ported the code to Visual Basic .NET!
When porting for Visual Basic .NET I modularized and "class"ified most of the code. Although most of the code was
translated by the VB.Net translator, I had To make a lot Of changes. The AI is very silly and should have been much better.
I should have used some kind of recursive method to find the best move. Since I don't have much time (for
this code) I leave it up to you. The Think() function should be a very good starting point. Eventually I
also cleaned up the UI. Building it in VB.NET from scratch eliminating all legacy UI code.
This code frankly speaking is open source/freeware. You can do whatever you want with it.
I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you,
your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk.
